# Week 1-4: Print 10 Odd Numbers Exercise

Printing the First 10 Odd Numbers

## Overview
This Python program prints the first 10 odd numbers from a given range of numbers. The program is built with a for loop and uses the modulus operator to filter out the even numbers, printing only the odd numbers.

## Approach
To achieve the desired output, the following plan was made:

- Use a for loop to iterate through a range of numbers.
- Use the modulus operator to filter out odd numbers.
- Print the odd numbers.

## Review

After reviewing the code, it was determined that the program correctly prints the first 10 odd numbers. This code can serve as a starting point for exploring other ways of solving this problem or adding additional features.
